                  geom_boxplot()+
                  facet_grid(.~supp)+
                  labs(title = "Tooth Length vs. Dose  by for OJ & VC",
                  x = "Doses", y = "Tooth Length")

# 2. Provide a basic summary of the data.


```r
            summary(ToothGrowth)
```

```
##       len        supp         dose

```

### Table view of data. 

```r
            table(ToothGrowth$supp,ToothGrowth$dose)
```

```
##     
##      0.5  1  2
##   OJ  10 10 10
##   VC  10 10 10
```

#3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. 

From the box plot, OJ looks to be doing better with dose 0.5 and 1 effect on teeth growth than VC. To test this hypothesis by hold a the mean of OJ and VC does not cross zero.

# dose 0.5
We are 95% confident that the limits of 1.719057 and 8.780943 actually do contain the difference between the two population means.Because those limts do not contain zero, this confodence interval suggests that it is very possible that the two population means are not equal.


```r
            ojdose0.5 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="OJ" & dose=="0.5")
            vcdose0.5 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="VC" & dose=="0.5")
            t.test(ojdose0.5$len,vcdose0.5$len)
```

```
## 
## 	Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  ojdose0.5$len and vcdose0.5$len
## t = 3.1697, df = 14.969, p-value = 0.006359
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  1.719057 8.780943
## sample estimates:
## mean of x mean of y 
##     13.23      7.98
```

# dose 1
We are 95% confident that the limits of 2.802148 and 9.057852 actually do contain the difference between the two population means. Because those limts do not contain zero, this confodence interval suggests that it is very possible that the two population means are not equal.


```r
            ojdose1 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="OJ" & dose=="1")
            vcdose1 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="VC" & dose=="1")
            t.test(ojdose1$len,vcdose1$len)
```

```
## 
## 	Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  ojdose1$len and vcdose1$len
## t = 4.0328, df = 15.358, p-value = 0.001038
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  2.802148 9.057852
## sample estimates:
## mean of x mean of y 
##     22.70     16.77
```

## dose 2
We are 95% confident that the limits of -3.79807 and 3.63807 actually do contain the difference between the two population means. However, because those limts do contain zero, this confodence interval suggests that it is very possible that the two population means are equal.


```r
            ojdose2 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="OJ" & dose=="2")
            vcdose2 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="VC" & dose=="2")
            t.test(ojdose2$len,vcdose2$len)
```

```
## 
## 	Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  ojdose2$len and vcdose2$len
## t = -0.046136, df = 14.04, p-value = 0.9639
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -3.79807  3.63807
## sample estimates:
## mean of x mean of y 
##     26.06     26.14
```

# 4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions. 
### We are 95% confident that dose 0.5 and dose 1 of OJ result in longer tooth length than dose 0.5 and dose 1 of VC. However, at the highest dose of 2, there is no statistically significant difference between the effects of OJ and VC.
